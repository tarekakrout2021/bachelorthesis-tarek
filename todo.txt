had to add src as a package to run it... should I use packages for all my code?

cd /home/titi/Documents/TarekAkrout/TU_Berlin/ML_BachelorArbeit/bachelorthesis-tarek/src
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:`pwd`
then run the code
this is only temporary... should I add it to the bashrc file?


Is there a better way to do the config for hydra ?
